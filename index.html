              sunhacks is a student-run hackathon at Arizona State University committed to growing the local tech community, providing students with brand new opportunities and connections, and contributing to a world-wide community: the hacker community. In April 2018, we hosted our first sunhacks to introduce Phoenix to the hacker community. Our vision this year is to bring programmers of all backgrounds and skill levels together for a 36-hour coding and building session to bring their project ideas to life at our second sunhacks.

                  <h3>What is a hackathon? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">Hackathons are places where you can have all sorts of experiences. You can watch you and your team's project come to life throughout a weekend, you can network with sponsors in a much more casual environment than career fair, you can meet new friends and learn about the present tech community, you can learn cool new tech that industry is thrilled to hear about, and more!
                    Come up with a project, or join a team, and make the coolest program you've come up with yet!</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>Can I attend? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">If you're a student and at least 18 years old, you're more than welcome to come participate!</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>Code of Conduct? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">As a Major League Hacking member event, we require all attendees (hackers, volunteers, mentors, sponsors, etc) to follow Major League Hacking’s <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>Can I get travel reimbursement? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">As sunhacks is still a young hackathon, we unfortunately do not yet have the funds to reimburse our attendees for their travel to get here. We sincerely apologize, but hope you understand. In the future when we're bigger, we hope to be able to help you out, so stay tuned!</p>

              <div class="faq-col">
                <div>
                  <h3>Why should I attend if I'm a beginner, a non-coder, a coder who doesn't feel like a coder? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">We all know what all of these feel like. We hope you can push past your concerns of being "good enough" and try our hackathon out. We're working on building a community that people especially like you can be a part of. We want to help you get better, find that network of support, and flourish!</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>How do teams work? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">This hackathon allows a max team size of 4 people. While the minimum team size is one (meaning yes, you can work by yourself), we'd love for you to consider the benefits of having someone (or a few someones) to bounce ideas off of and break work into manageable chunks! </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>Do I need to stay the whole time? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">To get the full experience we highly recommend you stay, but we understand if you need to leave or if you want to sleep in a real bed for the night.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>What if I don't have a team?<span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">Don't have a team? That's okay, after our opening ceremony, stick around to find some team members who want to help you with your project—or maybe you want to help them with theirs!</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>What about hardware hacks? <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">MLH will be generously renting out cutting edge technology to the hackers. From Oculus Rifts to Arduinos, the sky is the limit. If you have hardware or tools, you are more than welcome to bring them as well.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>What do I need to bring?  <span class="plus">+</span></h3>
                  <p class="answer">You'll need to bring a laptop, charger, any tech you might want to hack on or with. As we are a 3 day hackathon, we encourage you to bring toiletries and any other materials you deem relevant. We highly encourage you bring sleeping paraphernalia to ensure you get a good night's rest each night (or not, we understand you're excited to hack, but remember to take care of yourself!). We will have a sleeping area designated! <br />In addition, sunhacks is working toward becoming a sustainable hackathon, that means we aren't providing water bottles this year, and are asking that you bring your own. There may be some reward for your sustainable actions! Finally, in order to check-in on our opening day, you must have a valid ID and your ticket scan code.</p>
